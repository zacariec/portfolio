# My first portfolio.

## Built with Gatsby & React.

There's not much to it. This is my first ever portfolio.
I decided to build it with Gatsby & React to leverage Gatsby's fast loading times.
    
To keep my code clean and responsive in a mobile first manner, I styled it with
[Styled Components](www.styled-components.com) & [Styled Media Querys](https://github.com/morajabi/styled-media-query).

## Keeping it simple.

I'm completely new to the Web Dev game and as such decided to keep it simple and clean.
I want to showcase my ability to use HTML, CSS & JavaScript and hope to use this as a platform to do so.
